<!-- In English, we generally follow a **SVO _(subject-verb-object)_**:
``` python
I stab you
S V    O
```

In Tupi Antigo, we will always follow **OV _(object-verb)_** at a minumum. The language is pro-drop, meaning the subject may be ommitted when the context is clear enough to allow it. 

``` python
%Noun('kutuk', '(v.tr.)').conjugate(subject_tense='1ps', object_tense='2ps', pro_drop=True)%
O  V
```

Here, `oro-` is a <Tooltip content="2nd Person Singular (you/endé/nde/oro-)">_2ps_</Tooltip> object prefix _(nde)_. Given this prefix, the subject pronoun will always be <Tooltip content="1st Person (I/we/xe/oré)">_1p_</Tooltip>.

Depending on the context, this can mean `I stab you (%Noun('kutuk', '(v.tr.)').conjugate(subject_tense='1ps', object_tense='2ps', pro_drop=False)%)` or `We stab you (%Noun('kutuk', '(v.tr.)').conjugate(subject_tense='1ppe', object_tense='2ps', pro_drop=False)%)`

::: warning
It cannot be _îandé_ becuase it would be strange to include the object of the oration as a subject as well. Perhaps this semi-reflexivity is possible in poetry, but we will ignore such forms in this text.
