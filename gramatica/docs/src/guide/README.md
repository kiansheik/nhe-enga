The Tupian family consists of some 70 different South American languages, not all mutually intelligible. Many academic sources will refer to _Tupi Antigo_ as _Tupinambá_. We will not use this name as it can also pertain to one specific people group within the larger Tupi Antigo speaking community, and therefore does not represent the language which we are attempting to describe.  

It is a common misconception that the name of the language which was most widely spoken on the coast of Brazil is **Tupi-Guaraní**:

_Tupi-Guaraní_ is the name of the sub-family which contains Tupi Antigo, among other languages. _Paraguayan Guaraní_ is the most widely spoken language from the _Tupi-Guaraní_ sub-family, with ~7 million native speakers.

## Anchieta

Almost all of the texts we have today about Tupi Antigo were recorded by Jesuits, primariliy ___Father José de Anchieta___. Father Anchieta noted that the languages spoken by the peoples along the coast of Brazil were all very similar. He resolved to compile a standardized version of this language which we called _Língua Brasílica_. 

This language which he described is what we today call __Tupi Antigo__. He used this grammar to write _catechisms_ and _theatres_ in Tupi Antigo. The goal of these works was to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Brazil, or convert them to Christianity.

## General Languages

Over time as European men began to have children with Indigenous women, the dialects which contributed to what we know as _Tupi Antigo_ began to evolve due to European _(and to a lesser extent African)_ influence. Historically, we refer to these languages as _General Languages_. 

The two main varieties of _General Language_ spoken in what we now call Brazil were: 
1. Amazonian General Language (North)
1. Paulistan General Language (South)

::: warning
Closer to the south of Brazil and Paraguay, __Father Montoya__ was doing a parallel work with _Old Guaraní_, creating a grammar and evangilizing the peoples of the area. In those regions, there existed _General Languages_ based more heavily on Guaraní than Tupi Antigo. While parallel to what we are discussing, those languages are not descendents of _Tupi Antigo_
:::

With the arrival of the __Marques do Pombal__ in Brazil, he made a decree to outlaw the official use of any indigenous languages. Portuguese became number one. While this event did not single-handedly cause the downfall of Tupi Antigo as a _língua franca_ in Brazil, it set the stage for it's inevitable demise.

With the onset of mass immigration to Brazil from Europe, the Portuguese language slowly but surely replaced the _General Languages_ and _Tupi Antigo_ as the _língua franca_ in most of the country. 

By the start of the 19th century, the Paulistan General Language was already forgotten by the populace. 

## Nheengatu

The Amazonian General Language, however, did not completely die out. It continued to spread deep inland into the country. In these remote parts, Eurpoean immigration was much less common. 

Today, a living descendent of the _Amazonian General Language_ knows as __Nheengatu__ _(good language)_ is still spoken by around 20,000 people. It's worth noting that this language has replaced the _"original"_ language of it's speakers. As Brazilian colonization continued into the interior, the _General Languages_ were taught to and used to communicate with the non-tupian speaking peoples of the interior. 

As the _Amazonian General Language_ was the _lingua franca_ of the region, it ended up supplanting many local indigenous languages. This is how we have today __Nheengatu__; a language originally from the coast of Brazil which only survives far away, in the forests being spoken by non-tupian peoples.
