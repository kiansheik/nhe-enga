Many academic sources will refer to <em>Tupi Antigo</em> as <em>Tupinambá</em>. We will not use this name as it can also pertain to one specific people group within the larger Tupi Antigo speaking community, and therefore does not represent the language which we are attempting to describe.</p> <p>It is a common misconception that the name of the language which was most widely spoken on the coast of Brazil is <strong>Tupi-Guaraní</strong>:</p> <p><img src="/nhe-enga/imgs/linguas-tupi-guarani.jpeg" alt="Tupi guarani Languages"></p> <p><em>Tupi-Guaraní</em> is the name of the sub-family which contains Tupi Antigo, among other languages. <em>Paraguayan Guaraní</em> is the most widely spoken language from the <em>Tupi-Guaraní</em> sub-family, with ~7 million native speakers.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p><em>Guaraní</em> is the most widely spoken indigenous language in all of the Americas!</p></div> <h2 id="anchieta"><a href="#anchieta" class="header-anchor">#</a> Anchieta</h2> <p>Almost all of the texts we have today about Tupi Antigo were recorded by Jesuits, primariliy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_of_Anchieta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Father José de Anchieta</strong></em><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>. Father Anchieta noted that the languages spoken by the peoples along the coast of Brazil were all very similar.

He used this grammar to write <em>catechisms</em> and <em>theatres</em> in Tupi Antigo.

Portuguese became number one. While this event did not single-handedly cause the downfall of Tupi Antigo as a <em>língua franca</em> in Brazil, it set the stage for it's inevitable demise.</p> <p>With the onset of mass immigration to Brazil from Europe, the Portuguese language slowly but surely replaced the <em>General Languages</em> and <em>Tupi Antigo</em> as the <em>língua franca</em> in most of the country.</p> <p>By the start of the 19th century, the Paulistan General Language was already forgotten by the populace.</p> <h2 id="nheengatu"><a href="#nheengatu" class="header-anchor">#</a> Nheengatu</h2> <p>The Amazonian General Language, however, did not completely die out. It continued to spread deep inland into the country. In these remote parts, European immigration was much less common.</p> <p>Today, a living descendent of the <em>Amazonian General Language</em> known as <strong>Nheengatu</strong> <em>(good language)</em> is still spoken by around 20,000 people. It's worth noting that this language has replaced the <em>&quot;original&quot;</em> language of it's speakers. As Brazilian colonization continued into the interior, the <em>General Languages</em> were taught to and used to communicate with the non-tupian speaking peoples of the interior.</p> <p>As the <em>Amazonian General Language</em> was the <em>lingua franca</em> of the region, it ended up supplanting many local indigenous languages. This is how we have today <strong>Nheengatu</strong>; a language originally from the coast of Brazil which only survives far away, in the forests being spoken by non-tupian peoples.</p> <p><exercise answer="tîá nde ko'ema">How do you say <em>Good Morning</em> in Tupi Antigo?</exercise></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
