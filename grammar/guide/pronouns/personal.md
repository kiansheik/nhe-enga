# Personal Pronouns

The first type of pronoun in Tupi Antigo that we will cover are _personal pronouns_ and by extension _personal prefixes_.

| Lema | Person | Subject Pronoun | Subject Prefix |
|------|-----------------|--------|---|
| I    | 1ps             |  <py>n = Noun;n.personal_inflections["1ps"][0]</py>| <py>n.personal_inflections["1ps"][2]</py> |
| You  | 2ps            | <py>n.personal_inflections["2ps"][0]</py>| <py>n.personal_inflections["2ps"][2]</py>  |
| We _(Exclusive)_ | 1ppe    | <py>n.personal_inflections["1ppe"][0]</py>| <py>n.personal_inflections["1ppe"][2]</py>|
| We _(Inclusive)_ | 1ppi  | <py>n.personal_inflections["1ppi"][0]</py>| <py>n.personal_inflections["1ppi"][2]</py> |
| Y'all | 2pp           | <py>n.personal_inflections["2pp"][0]</py>| <py>n.personal_inflections["2pp"][2]</py>   |
| They  | 3p            | <py>n.personal_inflections["3p"][0]</py>| <py>n.personal_inflections["3p"][2]</py>    |

In Tupi Antigo, the <t3p/> does not distinguish between _singular_ and _plural_; context will dictate which is more likely.

::: tip
The <t3p/> pronouns can equally mean **he/she/they/it**.
:::

::: warning
In the English language, it is not uncommon to employ the pronouns `they/them/theirs` in both **plural** _and_ **singular** contexts. 

As it is important to get used to the Tupian mindset, this text will _most frequently_ translate the <t3p/> as **they** where it may be more natural to use **he/she**.
