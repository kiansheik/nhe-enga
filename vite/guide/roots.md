# Roots

In Tupi Antigo, it can often be unproductive to try to think of _"words of content"_ in terms of being inherently nouns or verbs. We will refer to the most basic form of lema in tupi by the word **Root**.

## Charectaristics of Roots

Each root has certain attributes about it which will affect the ways and places in which we can inflect and use this root. These Charectaristics are:

1. Transitivity
    - A root can be either Transitive or Intransitive
2. Conjugation class
    - An intransitive root _may_ be a second class verb, these recieving special treatment in regards to conjugation.
3. Pluriform
    - Any root may be what is called a _pluriform_ meaning that it will recieve specific prefixes governed based on it's class of plurformality.

These concepts will be discussed in further detail in later sections, feel free to skip around :)
